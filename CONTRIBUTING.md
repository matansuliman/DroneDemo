# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! This project welcomes small, focused contributions.

## Ways to contribute
- **Issues:** Bug reports, reproduction steps, environment details.
- **Docs:** Clarify README, add quickstart, fix typos.
- **Code / DevOps:** Small PRs only (≤ ~300 lines). Prefer one change per PR.

## Ground rules
- Be kind and specific.
- Ask before large refactors.
- Keep PRs small and reviewable.
- Write clear commit messages (Conventional Commits preferred, e.g., `fix: ...`, `feat: ...`, `docs: ...`).

## Getting started
1. **Discuss/assign** the Issue you want to tackle (label `good first issue` if you’re new).
2. **Fork** (or create a branch on this repo if you have write access).
3. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/<short-topic>
   ```
4. Make changes and run checks locally.
5. Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR) with:
   - What changed and why
   - How you tested it (commands, versions)
   - Any screenshots/logs if relevant
